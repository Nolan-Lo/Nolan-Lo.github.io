title: "Using Machine Learning to Explore Statcast Data"
excerpt: "Using machine learning, I answered and explored the following 3 questions. o Can pitch characteristics like velocity, spin rate, location, and pitch type predict batter whiff rates? o Can we use inherently talent based metrics like bat speed and swing length to predict batter success? o How do pitch selection and pitch effectiveness vary by inning and game state?"
