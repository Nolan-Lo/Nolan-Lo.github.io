title: "Using Machine Learning to Explore Statcast Data"
excerpt: |
  Using machine learning, I answered and explored the following 3 questions:
  - Can pitch characteristics like velocity, spin rate, location, and pitch type predict batter whiff rates?
  - Can we use inherently talent-based metrics like bat speed and swing length to predict batter success?
  - How do pitch selection and pitch effectiveness vary by inning and game state?
