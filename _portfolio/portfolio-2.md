title: "Using Machine Learning to Explore Statcast Data"
excerpt: "Using machine learning, I explored three key questions: (1) Can pitch characteristics like velocity, spin rate, location, and pitch type predict batter whiff rates? (2) Can talent-based metrics like bat speed and swing length predict batter success? (3) How do pitch selection and effectiveness vary by inning and game state?"
